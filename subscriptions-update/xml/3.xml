It turns out that Sekara, an orangutan at the Perth Zoo, did just that when her 5-year-old baby Sungai lost grip on some equipment and fell into a garden bed on Sunday, according to

Everyone around was really calm and giving her space as well. The whole incident was probably only 30-40 seconds before staff arrived,&amp;quot; Jess McConnell, a witness, told the news outlet.  Perth Zoo spokesperson Danielle Henry told the news outlet that the incident was &amp;quot;over within 15 minutes,&amp;quot; and Sekara remained calm and returned to keepers afterward. &amp;quot;Sekara is an excellent mum and a bit of a helicopter parent, and the only way to get to him was to pop onto the visitor board. She retrieved him and returned to the enclosure on her own,&amp;quot; Henry said.  &amp;quot;Keepers were calling to her, and she has a very good relationship with them.&amp;quot; The zoo will also conduct a review of the incident.

It turns out that Sekara, an orangutan at the Perth Zoo, did just that when her 5-year-old baby Sungai lost grip on some equipment and fell into a garden bed on Sunday, according to 
&lt;em&gt;WA Today&lt;/em&gt;. SEE ALSO: Rejected penguin has found new outlook on life with cutout of anime character Visitors were evacuated from the area for safety, but zoo staff were quick to respond to the incident. &amp;quot;She seemed really calm, just confused on where to go next. Everyone around was really calm and giving her space as well. The whole incident was probably only 30-40 seconds before staff arrived,&amp;quot; Jess McConnell, a witness, told the news outlet.  Perth Zoo spokesperson Danielle Henry told the news outlet that the incident was &amp;quot;over within 15 minutes,&amp;quot; and Sekara remained calm and returned to keepers afterward. &amp;quot;Sekara is an excellent mum and a bit of a helicopter parent, and the only way to get to him was to pop onto the visitor board. She retrieved him and returned to the enclosure on her own,&amp;quot; Henry said.  &amp;quot;Keepers were calling to her, and she has a very good relationship with them.&amp;quot; The zoo will also conduct a review of the incident.

The &amp;quot;northern lights,&amp;quot; as they are often called, originate with our sun. Solar storms that occur there emit streams of charged particles which help to trigger the unusual light show once they reach Earth. SEE ALSO: The mystery of panda&amp;apos;s fur color is finally solved The magnetic fields emanating from our north and south poles pull the charged particles down into our upper (and sometimes lower) atmosphere, where some of them collide with the neutral particles that reside there. The result of this collision is a beautiful glowing sky, though it&amp;apos;s usually visible only at higher latitudes. In the Northern Hemisphere it&amp;apos;s an &amp;quot;aurora borealis&amp;quot; and in the Southern Hemisphere it&amp;apos;s an &amp;quot;aurora australis.&amp;quot; Saturday evening&amp;apos;s aurora borealis extended further south than is normal for these events, which meant it was visible in the northern U.S., Canada, and parts of Europe. It was the result of the sun spitting out a large burst of plasma on May 23, an event referred to as a Coronal Mass Ejection (CME). The internet expressed its thanks for the cosmic light show in the only way it knows how: social media shares enhanced by stunning photography.  WOW! Northern Lights seen tonight from Cape Cod, Massachusetts.

&gt;&lt;/a&gt;By Ahmed Aboulenein  CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt made clear on Monday that it planned to press ahead with air strikes against Islamist militants in neighbouring Libya who it says were

&lt;p&gt;Normally $2.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Give Oilist an image and it will automatically generate a genuine and unique work of art based on it. Painted for you in real time! Participate or spectate, it&amp;#39;s up to you, Oilist will delight!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oilist comes with 18 infinitely customizable styles; from impressionist to abstract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oilist is not a photo filter. Unlike most filter apps, Oilist will never generate the same results twice, and is capable of creating from impressionistic to abstract artwork based on the user’s photos. Instead of applying a fixed formula to an image as photo filters typically do, Oilist analyzes the supplied image using computer vision technology, then paints simulated paint particles that are applied using various brush strokes and techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At anytime during the painting process, 4k resolution images may be captured as often as desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Oilist is painting, styles may be infinitely customized by selecting from 12 different painting moods, choosing from 15 different brushes, setting brush options such as the size and spacing, and by injecting imperfections with the exciting Chaos tool. The gravity of the paint can be controlled by tilting the device and the brush angles may be controlled by yawing (rotating) the device. To rapidly change settings, it is possible to pause the painting by tapping in the paint area, make any desired changes, the tap in the painting area again to unpause the painting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New and interesting results may be obtained by alternating settings with new settings painted on top of the previous settings. For instance, first paint a layer using the Warm mood followed by a layer using the Cool mood. The use of large brushes tend to create more abstract artwork and smaller brushes work best for high definition detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oilist will automatically provide smaller brush strokes and greater photo-realism to detected faces. This can optionally be disabled by opening the Settings app, tapping on Oilist and disabling face detection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Golden Geek Best Solo Board Game Nominee, Onirim is a card game where you play as a Dreamwalker, lost in a mysterious labyrinth, and you must discover the oneiric doors before your dreamtime runs out - or you will remain trapped forever!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wander through the chambers of dreams, hoping that chance will reveal the doors, or linger in each type of room. In either case, you will have to deal with the slithering Nightmares which haunt the hallways of the labyrinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onirim is a solitaire card game. You must work against the game to gather the eight oneiric doors before the deck runs out. You can obtain door cards either by playing cards of the same color three turns in a row or by discarding one of your powerful key cards when a door appears from the deck. In both cases, you will have to decide the best use of each card in your hand and carefully play around the Nightmares. Those cards are hidden in the deck and will trigger painful dilemmas when drawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the exciting solo mode, players will enjoy the intuitive user interface, automated deck management, and stats to track their progress and successes against the game!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onirim includes :&lt;br&gt;
• Shadi Torbey&amp;#39;s base Onirim game in solitaire mode&lt;br&gt;
• Original artwork from the base game by Philippe Guerin and Elise Plessis, enhanced by animations&lt;br&gt;
• Solo play&lt;br&gt;
• Detailed, interactive, turn-by-turn, in-game tutorial.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zen Sketch is a cross between a note-taking and a painting app. We wanted to give people an app with a balance between power and simplicity: A place that could stay out of the way and let them think, but also contained an environment with the ability to add serious detail to their work. And so Zen Sketch was born. The app goes beyond regular ink handwriting apps by using an industry standard drawing/painting engine, but still organizes your work in a logical fashion like any good note-taking app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use Zen Sketch to create powerful notes or paintings. All your work can easily be exported out of the app as images or PDFs, and shared in just about every way imaginable. The app has no learning curve, and lets you work in a streamlined and clean interface designed with the latest technology in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selecting the foreground area (area to be remaining as sharp) is the key factor to get the best possible result. The selection tool in this app was designed and developed to meet your detail-oriented editing needs. It will display a loupe (magnifying glass) when you zoom-in and try to select/deselect area. The loupe is very handy because otherwise you can&amp;#39;t see the spot you&amp;#39;re touching as your finger is blocking your view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also adjust bokeh level (aperture) to control how much your photo&amp;#39;s background should be bokeh-blurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Oilist&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://media.zenfs.com/en_US/News/BGR_News/oilist.jpeg?quality=98&amp;strip=all" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5572126" alt="" width="392" height="696"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally $2.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Give Oilist an image and it will automatically generate a genuine and unique work of art based on it. Painted for you in real time! Participate or spectate, it&amp;#39;s up to you, Oilist will delight!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oilist comes with 18 infinitely customizable styles; from impressionist to abstract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oilist is not a photo filter. Unlike most filter apps, Oilist will never generate the same results twice, and is capable of creating from impressionistic to abstract artwork based on the user’s photos. Instead of applying a fixed formula to an image as photo filters typically do, Oilist analyzes the supplied image using computer vision technology, then paints simulated paint particles that are applied using various brush strokes and techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At anytime during the painting process, 4k resolution images may be captured as often as desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Oilist is painting, styles may be infinitely customized by selecting from 12 different painting moods, choosing from 15 different brushes, setting brush options such as the size and spacing, and by injecting imperfections with the exciting Chaos tool. The gravity of the paint can be controlled by tilting the device and the brush angles may be controlled by yawing (rotating) the device. To rapidly change settings, it is possible to pause the painting by tapping in the paint area, make any desired changes, the tap in the painting area again to unpause the painting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New and interesting results may be obtained by alternating settings with new settings painted on top of the previous settings. For instance, first paint a layer using the Warm mood followed by a layer using the Cool mood. The use of large brushes tend to create more abstract artwork and smaller brushes work best for high definition detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oilist will automatically provide smaller brush strokes and greater photo-realism to detected faces. This can optionally be disabled by opening the Settings app, tapping on Oilist and disabling face detection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Golden Geek Best Solo Board Game Nominee, Onirim is a card game where you play as a Dreamwalker, lost in a mysterious labyrinth, and you must discover the oneiric doors before your dreamtime runs out - or you will remain trapped forever!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wander through the chambers of dreams, hoping that chance will reveal the doors, or linger in each type of room. In either case, you will have to deal with the slithering Nightmares which haunt the hallways of the labyrinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onirim is a solitaire card game. You must work against the game to gather the eight oneiric doors before the deck runs out. You can obtain door cards either by playing cards of the same color three turns in a row or by discarding one of your powerful key cards when a door appears from the deck. In both cases, you will have to decide the best use of each card in your hand and carefully play around the Nightmares. Those cards are hidden in the deck and will trigger painful dilemmas when drawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the exciting solo mode, players will enjoy the intuitive user interface, automated deck management, and stats to track their progress and successes against the game!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onirim includes :&lt;br&gt;
• Shadi Torbey&amp;#39;s base Onirim game in solitaire mode&lt;br&gt;
• Original artwork from the base game by Philippe Guerin and Elise Plessis, enhanced by animations&lt;br&gt;
• Solo play&lt;br&gt;
• Detailed, interactive, turn-by-turn, in-game tutorial.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zen Sketch is a cross between a note-taking and a painting app. We wanted to give people an app with a balance between power and simplicity: A place that could stay out of the way and let them think, but also contained an environment with the ability to add serious detail to their work. And so Zen Sketch was born. The app goes beyond regular ink handwriting apps by using an industry standard drawing/painting engine, but still organizes your work in a logical fashion like any good note-taking app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use Zen Sketch to create powerful notes or paintings. All your work can easily be exported out of the app as images or PDFs, and shared in just about every way imaginable. The app has no learning curve, and lets you work in a streamlined and clean interface designed with the latest technology in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
